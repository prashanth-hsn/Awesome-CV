% Entry: Write some good entry line.

I am a passionate C++ developer specialized in Scientific computing with over 
nine years of experience. I found this job posted on the r/cpp subreddit, and I 
was very thrilled at the prospect of working for \company{}, since the 
CAE tools developed by \company{} are ubiquitous in the industry. \newline{}
With the combination of my C++ and CAE software development experience, in 
addition to my Masters in Computational Sciences, I believe that I would make 
a great fit for the CFD Software Engineer position.

%Was kannst Du? (What can you do?)
At my current job with gns-mbh, I work on the development and maintenance of 
Animator4, an industry standard FEM Post-processor. 
Working on a software that is widely used in the industry has an advantage that 
the software we ship gets pushed to the limits, and it keeps us on our toes to 
make sure that it is capable of handling everything that is thrown at it. 
Over the past decade the trend with FEA is to analyze bigger geometry 
with several million nodes. Which means larger result files, sometimes over 100 
GB. To achieve good import speeds and low memory footprints, I spend 
considerable time in benchmarking the algorithms and data structures using tools
 such as gprof, intel-vtune, valgrind:massif etc.
This experience has helped me gain an intuition to recognize patterns in code
which can potentially cause issues.   
I am the core maintainer for several input interfaces, which parse such FEM 
result data files. The data formats range from simple ascii data to hdf5, binary, 
xml etc. So I am quite proficient in importing and exporting scientific data. 
I also write shader programs for rendering fem geometry and results. This has 
improved my skills in gpu programming for 3d graphics using opengl standards.
Apart from writing c++ code, I also take care of Nightly test result evaluation
and the Official release coordination. This has helped me hone my planning and 
communication skills.

%Wer bist Du? (who are you?) 
I studied Masters in Computational Sciences (CSE) at TU-Braunschweig with focus 
on Parallel computing, FEM and CFD. For my Master's thesis I upgraded a legacy 
Turbo machinery CFD post-processor from Fortran-77 to Fortran-95 and then 
parallelized it using MPI Standards at MAN Diesel and Turbo. This was a very 
successful undertaking.     

%Warum willst Du gerade zu diesem Unternehmen? (Why do you want to join this 
% company?) 
What drives me as a software developer is the stories of impact the software has
 on the user's work. I believe \company{}'s software has always been a 
 game-changer, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with 3d modelling 
and numerical simulation. This is a major motivation for my desire to work for 
\company{}. And the role of CFD solver developer makes it even more exciting, 
as I always wanted to work on scientific computing software where I can put my 
practical c++ development experience and the theoretical knowledge on CFD and
mathematics to practice.

%Was hat das Unternehmen davon, wenn es Dich einstellt? (What does the company 
% benefit from if it hires you

I am very excited about the work of \company{} and welcome the opportunity to 
speak with you further about the career opportunities at \company{} and how I 
can contribute. Thank you for your time and consideration.
