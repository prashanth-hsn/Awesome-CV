% Entry: Write some good entry line.

I found this job posted on the r/cpp subreddit and I was very thrilled at the prospect of working for XYZ, since
the CAE tools developed by XYZ are ubiquitous in the industry.

%Was kannst Du? (What can you do?)
I am a passionate C++ developer specialized in Scientific computing with over nine years of experience in shipping a
 very successful product, Animator4, in the Automotive industry. 
Animator4 is an industry standard FEM Post-processor developed by gns-mbh.  
I am the core maintainer for several input interfaces, which parse the FEM result data files. 
One of them is the Abaqus Odb reader interface.
Apart from being a senior developer, I also take care of Nightly test result evaluation and Official release coordination. 
This has helped me hone my planning and communication skills.

%Wer bist Du? (who are you?) 
I studied Masters in Computational Sciences at TU-Braunschweig with focus on Parallel computing, FEM and CFD. For my Master's thesis 
I upgraded an old Turbomachinery CFD post-processor from Fortran-77 to Fortran-95 and then parallelized using MPI Standards at the 
MAN Diesel and Turbo. 
This was a very successful undertaking and my advisor wrote me letter of recommendation, 
which I have attached with along with other relevant documents.

I appreciate the dynamic nature of the software engineering. from the programming language to the tooling, everything keeps evolving at a rapid pace. For example since 2011, C++ standards commitee is churning out major updates every three years. It is exciting to try new feature of the language and witness the direction in which computing is headed.
