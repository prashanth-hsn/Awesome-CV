One of such input interfce reads the FEM data from Abaqus odb file, which is the FEA software in the 3DS Simulia software suite. 
%At my current job I mostly work with C++17, Qt5, python3, CMake, opengl and svn. 
I have a lot of fun solving complex algorithmic and architecural problems. I appreciate the dynamic nature of the software engineering. from the programming language to the tooling, everything keeps evolving at a rapid pace. For example since 2011, C++ standards commitee is churning out major updates every three years. It is exciting to try new feature of the language and witness the direction in which computing is headed.


Apart from the development role, I also act as one of the release manager. Which requires to coordinate with all the stake holders to make sure that the software shipped is of highest quality and correct.
